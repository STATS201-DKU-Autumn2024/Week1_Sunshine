# Bitcoin Blockchain Cohort Data

This dataset offers a comprehensive analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain, focusing on cohort-based transaction behaviors and economic activity. Published in [Scientific Data](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/deciphering-bitcoin-blockchain-data-by-cohort), the data allows users to examine trends and dynamics within Bitcoin user cohorts over time. The dataset spans transactions from Bitcoin’s inception in 2009 and categorizes them based on various transaction and cohort features, providing a unique lens into user activity and Bitcoin’s economic evolution.

Available as open-access on the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/XSZQWP), the dataset is structured to support data science research, particularly in economic modeling, transaction pattern analysis, and network analysis. Researchers can utilize this dataset to explore the influence of new user cohorts on the overall Bitcoin economy, identify behavior patterns, and apply it for predictive modeling in blockchain studies.
