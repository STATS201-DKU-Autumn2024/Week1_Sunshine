# Bitcoin Blockchain Cohort Data

This dataset provides a detailed analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain, focusing on cohort-based transaction behaviors and economic activity. Published in *Scientific Data* [1], the dataset enables users to examine trends and dynamics within Bitcoin user cohorts over time. It includes transaction data from Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, categorized by various transaction and cohort characteristics, offering a unique perspective on user activity and the evolution of Bitcoin’s economic landscape.

Available as open-access on the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/XSZQWP), the dataset is structured to support data science research, particularly in economic modeling, transaction pattern analysis, and network analysis. Researchers can utilize this dataset to explore the impact of new user cohorts on the broader Bitcoin economy, identify behavior patterns, and apply it in predictive modeling for blockchain studies.
